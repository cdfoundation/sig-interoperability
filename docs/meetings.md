      - TM: [Sign up for newsletter](https://cd.foundation/stay-connected/)
  - [SIG Update to TOC](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/169XI0xHzltPJfGI4ZBSoZ1-y0DLabe8uKueDbsW9f8E/edit?usp=sharing), All
      - FD: The update to the CDF TOC will be given during the meeting on May 5th which starts at 16:00UtC. The agenda/logistics are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBHar55fTInWF9Li4t0lyG3tTC8BRLU0FfBfsgk_Jrs/edit?ts=5c9580be#heading=h.9z0srzj4rtji).
  - Discussion on proposed [SIG/WG CI Robots](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/issues/77), Max Korbi, All
      - MK: Noticed some challenges when integrating various tools/projects together.
      - MK: Everyhing that happens before CI/CD starts but on the technical level there is too much to be visible to everyone. Some auidences may not be familiar with the technical details of CI/CD and it is important to make this visible to thhose people as well.
      - MK: Three tools are mentioned - [PRobot](https://github.com/probot/probot), [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) even though it is a test framework, and GitHub Bot which is an alternative, being a kind of communication interface between the pipelines and users.
      - JR: Jenkins X has automation around approving PRs, etc. using Lighthouse. When one repo changes, it is necessary to keep things in sync especially towards downstream repos.
      - MK: It is really about bridging the gap between human and the technical part of the deployment.
      - JR: ChatOps. Having ability to control and being able to extend in order to add custom controls. Related to developer experience, helping them due to having consistent way to interact with the pipelines. This is more and more important in microservices world.
      - TM: It points the need for clarity for the users.
      - RA: What is the proposal? Is it to create a standard interface for all the existing and future tools to adhere to?
      - MK: It could be one of the outcomes and there is not much available in the market. It is not utilized well and there is still quite big gap.
      - MK: SIG may be big to start with so it could be a WG to identify what we are going to work with. We will identify if this WG has any value or not during the process.
      - RA: Trying to understand what is the gap. For example Robot framework already has a protocol and interfaces of doing things, and also have libraries so what the work would be for SIG/WG to do.
      - MK: This could be one of the outcome of the work proposed SIG/WG does. It would be interesting to understand to see how the integration between Robot & Prow with Github and so on. It may be difficult to adapt these to your own tools and pipelines. It's not yet a field with many options/tools around so we are at the phase to identify it.
      - TM: One way to approach this is to break tasks down. Everybody understtands one set of tools but not all and we can identify what tool is doing what and how these tools could operate and so on. Will look at the roadmap to see where this could be put under.
      - AP to all: Look at the roadmap to see if this fits under Next section in [Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSzcV-rl3XwkNh4_5a_0YCugF5gprtBR-xRlzuEJ-NA/edit#heading=h.8ve85us1mswx)

    - FD: Meeting time: There was a tie between 15:00-16:00UTC and 17:00-18:00UTC.
      FD opted for 15:00-16:00UTC to increase the possibility of participation
      from APAC.
    - FD: Question to all: Should we stick to UTC for meeting times?
    - FD: Summer time starts in few weeks. (US@March 8th, Europe@March 29th)
      The question was if we should stick to UTC and do not change the meeting
      time based on summer time changes or not.
    - FD: Agreed: The agreement is to stick to UTC.
  - Meeting agenda/notes
    - FD: Google Docs (this document) as working copy
    - FD: Github as the final location
    - FD: Meeting agenda and notes are kept in both places to ensure everyone
      can access those.
    - TM: hackmd.io is used by some communities and could be something we can
      look into for keeping meeting agenda and notes.
  - Invitation to join to maillist and Slack channel
    - FD: Crossposting to maillists is not considered as a good practice by
      some communities and we intend to stop doing that so we urge everyone
      to join to sig-interoperability maillist in order not to miss announcements,
      discussions, meeting information.
    - FD: Please join to #sig-interoperability channel on CDF Slack.
  - SIG Governance & Process
    - FD: Proposal is to have TOC document governance for the SIGs and we adapt it.
      See [the corresponding issue](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/issues/70)
      in TOC repo.
    - Adapting co-chair setup
      - FD: Question to all: Should we adapt co-chair setup that seems to be a
        common practice within CDF and CNCF SIGs?
      - FD: Agreed: Everyone is in agreement to have co-chair adapted.
      - FD: 2 additional co-chairs - 1 from projects and 1 from users to have
        different views represented.
      - TM: nominates Christie Wilson as co-chair.
      - TM: let’s give people time to think
      - JoshuaS: nominates Wavell Watson as co-chair.
    - FD: will send a mail to maillist/slack to summarize the governance discussion
      and agreement on adapting co-chair.
    - FD: will send a separate mail to start co-chair nominations.
    - Election of and terms of chair(s)
      - FD: suggestion is to have 2-year term but the question will be included
      in the mail that will be sent to SIG maillist.
  - Members of sig-interoperability team/repo
    - FD: Question to all: Who should/wants to be maintainer to sig-interoperability
    repo reviewing/merging PRs?
    - FD: Agreed: We start with the people listed as members in README.md.
  - How new-members could sign-up?
    - FD: For SIGs, the practice is to let people self-declare their interest and
    list themselves in members list if they would like to.
    - ES: Suggests to try to keep things simple which everyone agrees.
  - Upcoming presentations from users and projects
    - FD: We started inviting users/project maintainers to SIG meetings to present
    the challenges they face, the ideas they have, and the solutions they employed
    in order to increase collaboration. This will give us have chance to see and
    listen different perspectives.
    - FD: This will also make the existing work going on within interoperability
    area across projects visible.
    - FD: presentation backlog/schedule is on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Owg_I52WEXzqF8g_lX6OTdwbHkH4Z2-7TBA7eCSVMqY/edit#
    - TM: We can invite ebay, CDF projects
  - Discussion around our vision and objectives as SIG
    - FD: README file has few points. We can perhaps make our vision and objectives
    more explicit.
  - What interoperability means in CI/CD domain?
    - FD: People have different views when it comes to interoperability
    - JR: benefits of working with various communities are huge - standardization
    and so on. Having a way to come together to start talking about interoperability
    is great.
    - FD: pipeline standardization, event driven CI/CD, pipeline language
    - JR: Tekton and Jenkins X specifications. Jenkins X created a syntax familiar
    for Jenkins users which also works for Tekton. Consistent way.
    - ES: have been looking for the opportunities with regards to interoperability
    on an individual unit level.
    - ES: Standardized declarative metadata e.g. to describe deployments
    - ES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16e1xo1C35wBEe1skxnkgm2edGaxErhDoiN-jtIZkZM8/edit#
    - EB: look for possibilities in broader take on standardization
    - FD: being agnostic to the product is something to think about
    - WW: focusing on benefits such as: how to figure out the changes happening
    elsewhere which impacts you.
    - TC: AI/ML work done is highly regulated and CI/CD process is needed.
    Standardization/unification would be beneficial.
    - JS: There are some fundamental ideas to work with. Zuul has speculative
    execution and processes and it has pipelines. Events are used for triggering
    pipelines. Standard glossary/dictionary is needed. We need a language for humans
    to communicate first before we tackle with the tools. It would be good to see
    what people are actually dealing with.
