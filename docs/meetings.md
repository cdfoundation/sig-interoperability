### November 17, 2022

#### Participants
* Justin Abrahms, eBay
* Emil Bäckmark, Ericsson
* Fatih Degirmenci, CDF
* Terry Cox

#### Agenda & Notes
* CDF Interoperability Whitepaper, All
    * It would be good to refresh and simplify the whitepaper so it can be published.
    * The target date for publishing it could be 2023Q1 so we start the year with highlighting our efforts in the area.
    * v1: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bgr6EHhW4wUTphU8xyMg87qzSee43PEA_gGdMnPHq9Q/edit#
        * Feedback when it was originally prepping for release was "this isn't a whitepaper"
    * v2: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5jHbuEQuspwYOruVB4L5-rG8E1wQm5chq8QN7BrrBs/edit#
        * Removed case studies (dated, lack of point-of-contact)
        * Still a need for this paper to discuss the problem space
            * Some portions are partially addressed, but there are new emerging interoperability ideas/concerns
    * AI: Justin (with Melissa?) will push forward this document with a target of Q1 of 2023.
    * AI: Fatih to pre-flight the whitepaper idea w/ LF

    * current docs/projects are "open source & bottom up" which don't take a hollistic view of the whole problem space
    * There are two camps, from user interviews: 
        * folks who are steeped in CD culture
        * folks who have a loose grasp on what CD means but need some help understanding how to get value from it or get from where they are to where they need to be
    * The work will be to define the common patterns used in pipelines
    * The MLOps space, as an example, is not very well connected to traditional CD pipelines.

        - We do ask that speakers be at cdCon in person and present their talks live at cdCon.
        - However, restrictions are loosening around the world and travelling to cdCon will likely be possible for most individuals (although regretably maybe not for all)
    * We are currently organising the Contributor Summits for cdCon 2022. 
        * The Contributor Summits are focused on CDF projects: https://cd.foundation/projects/
        * For all CDF projects that are interested in hosting a Contributor Summit at cdCon, please appoint a lead organiser/host for your summit and have that individual fill out the form below:

    * Would be interesting to outline or create a catalogue of quality gates. 
        * Gather a list of what quality gates companies and teams are using in the wild. 
            * Mini case studies for different quality gates would be interesting.
            * How to gather: Survey? Shoutout on channels? See action items below.
            * Relates to best practices
            * Also, would be interesting to consider how to evaluate pipelines (not testing the actual pipeline or security concerns, necessarily), but really what should a pipeline contain. Again, very much a best practices question.
            * What signals do we use for quality?
                * execution speed of pipelines, etc
                * How many quality checks, ideal range
                * how do the quality checks bucket -- interesting to see if this becomes evident once catalogue created (eg, gates in place pre and post production/rollout)
* \<addme\>

#### Action Items
* [Justin Abrahms to create discussion on Interop SIG repo on what quality gates on being used by teams.](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/discussions/83)
* Kara to make sure CDF publicizes the discussion.
* Kara to bring in others, from Styra, etc, to discuss how they see quality gates being used in practice.
