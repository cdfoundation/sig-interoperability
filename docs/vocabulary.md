## Introduction

There are many ways to greet someone and as humans if we do not understand the
word being used we have the ability to observe body language, process tone,
and even touch. These many different natural inputs allow us as humans to
establish shared vocabulary upon which we have been able to build successful
components relevant to our way of living and social norms of interacting.

Unfortunately for machines, this process is not so easy as we humans have to
decide if we want to establish norms which we often surface when talking about
machine interactions as protocols and best practices or requirements.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)  practitioners have
many tools at their disposal but it is often the case that what we call a
pipeline in todayâ€™s tool of choice is not called the same thing in the tool we
use tomorrow. Again, we can within our sphere of influence and interaction
adjust for these nuances but machines talking to one another do not have that
same luxury necessarily.

The purpose of this document is to collect the basic terms used by CI/CD tools
and technologies in order to work on establishing a shared vocabulary for us
humans to communicate and collaborate better.

## Terminology Used by CI/CD Tools and Technologies

This section contains list of some key terms used by various CI/CD tools and
technologies.

### ArgoCD

[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Some of the core ArgoCD concept are listed below: [[16]]

- **Application**: A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
- **Application controller** [[19]]: Kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares live vs. desired state.
- **Application source type**: Which tool is used to build the application.
- **Target state**: The desired state of an application, as represented by files in a Git repository.
- **Live state**: The live state of that application. What pods etc are deployed.
- **Sync status**: Whether or not the live state matches the target state. Is the deployed application the same as Git says it should be?
- **Sync**: The process of making an application move to its target state. E.g. by applying changes to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Sync operation status**: Whether or not a sync succeeded.
- **Refresh**: Compare the latest code in Git with the live state. Figure out what is different.
- **Health**: The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?
- **Tool**: A tool to create manifests from a directory of files. E.g. Kustomize or Ksonnet. See Application Source Type.
- **Configuration management tool**: See tool.
- **Configuration management plugin**: A custom tool.
- **Project** [[17]]: A logical grouping of applications. They enable control over deployment permissions based on source, target and kind, among other criteria.
- **Sync phases** [[18]]: Pre-sync, sync and post-sync allow for controlled orchestrated execution of sync operations.
- **Sync waves**: Within any one sync phase, an additional control of sequential execution is accomplished using waves, to ensure certain resources are healthy before subsequent resources are synced.

### CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com) allows teams to rapidly build quality
projects, at scale.

Some of the core CircleCI terms are listed below. [[1]]

- **Step**: A step is a collection of executable commands.

Some of the core Codefresh concepts are listed below: [[20]]

- **Projects**: The top-level concept in Codefresh. You can create projects to group pipelines that are related. In most cases a single project will be a single application (that itself contains many micro-services).
- **Pipelines**: Each project can have multiple pipelines. Pipelines that belong to a single project are easily managed all together. 
- **Pipeline Steps**: Each pipeline has a definition that defines the pipeline steps that are executed each time this pipeline is triggered. The definition of a pipeline is described in a special codefresh.yml file. 
- **Triggers**: Each pipeline can have zero, one, or more triggers. Triggers are the linking medium between a pipeline and a git repository. Codefresh supports several kinds of triggers such as Git, Cron or Docker push triggers. 

### Eiffel

[Eiffel](https://eiffel-community.github.io/) is a technology agnostic CI/CD event protocol. The events and their parameters are generic enough to cover any kind of CI/CD engine/framework and SCMs.

- **Activity**: An activity is any kind of action in a CI/CD system, normally triggered by an operation done in an SCM system or by a previous activity. Activities are hierarchical. Activities could be whole pipelines, pipeline steps or any level of pipeline sub steps.
- **Event**: An Eiffel event is a broadcast notification telling any consumer about an event occurring in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Artifact**: Artifacts are items or software packages generated in a CI/CD pipeline, for example a built binary or a Docker image. An artifact should be possible to identify using a purl ([package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)). An artifact is often the subject of a test executed or a delivery performed within a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Environment**: An Eiffel environment defines the environment in which an activity is executed. Could be for example a host, node, service name/uri, a Docker image or some other kind of machine configuration definition.
- **Source Change**: A source change is the unit of a review. It results in a single commit when merged to the Git repository.
- **Submit**: A submit is the action of merging a source change to its intended target branch.
- *Pipeline*: A pipeline is not a term defined by Eiffel, but it is used in the Eiffel protocol documentation when explaining how Eiffel events can be combined to form a chain of activities often triggered by a source change being created or submitted.
- *Step*: A step is not a term defined by Eiffel, but it is used in the Eiffel protocol documentation to exemplify activities executed in a pipeline.

## Mapping of Terms

The Tools and Technologies listed in this document use more or less same
terminology for naming things with few differences, workflow vs pipeline or
runner vs node except the smaller units of work.

Fields marked as *N/A* in the tables below means that the author of this
document failed to identify corresponding term in the documentation of those
tools and does not mean those units of work are not supported by the tools.
Fields containing a question mark is the author's guess and might be incorrect.

### CI/CD Tools and Technologies

The table below is an attempt to create a mapping of different terms used
by CI/CD Tools and Technologies and could contain errors. The main term used
while creating the table is **pipeline** since almost all the tools listed in
this document use the word pipeline to describe pretty similar things. Smaller
units of terms then mapped based on how they are described in relation to
pipeline in corresponding documentation.

### Pipeline Stages

The list below is an attempt to create a mapping of common names for Stages, where a Stage is defined here as the unit of work one degree smaller than a Pipeline. (The effort of proposing a common vocabulary across CI/CD Tools and Technologies is not yet performed, but we'll use the most common term from the table above as the working term.)

While CI/CD Tools and Technologies generally give developers broad leeway in naming and implementing their Stages, agreeing upon some common terms will help develop more pluggable Pipelines.

The concepts below can be re-ordered in Pipeline implementations. For example, it is often the case that software linting (logically a test) is done prior to the Build Stage. Also, deployment to a staging environment is often done prior to the Release Stage, while the deployment for production often happens after the Release Stage.

In Pipeline implementations, there may also be other Stages preceding or following the ones listed below.

In the lists and table below, Software Artifacts includes: Documentation Source Files, Source Code, Baseline/Composition/Dependency Information, Infrastructure as Code.

"Software Source" refers to human-readable source files that are inputs to the pipeline, such as: Source Code, Configuration Files, Documentation Source Files, Declared Dependencies, Baseline/Composition Information (i.e. lock files in source control)

"Binary Source" refers to executables that are inputs to the pipeline, such as: Executable Software Dependencies, Container Images, Virtual Machine Images

"Generated Software" refers to human-readable files that are outputs of the pipeline, such as: Compiled Software, Generated Configuration Files, Compiled Documentation, Baseline/Composition Information generated by the pipeline. 

"Generated Binaries" refers to executables that are outputs of the pipeline, such as: Executable Software, Container Images, Virtual Machine Images

#### Any Stage
* Semantics: Some inputs and outputs are used across any and all stages. They're listed here once, rather than repeating them for each stage.
* Aliases: N/A
* Inputs: Secrets, Pipeline Environment, Pipeline Workspace, Pipeline Utility Tools
* Outputs: Stage Results and Return Codes, Logs

#### OSS Introduction Stage
* Semantics: Download open source software source code in order to analyze it to determine if it adheres to organizational policies from licensing, security, and compliance perspective.
* Aliases: Introduce
* Inputs: Public/Upstream URL to source code repository of the primary OSS, version of the primary OSS, Organizational Policies
* Outputs: Metadata, records, logs, SBOM, evaluation result/score based on organizational policies
* Other Results and Side Effects: The Introducation stage may also download community generated SBOM for the given version of the OSS if available, generate SBOM using the tools organization uses, generate statistics for determining community health (e.g., no of contributors, release frequency), analyze the primary OSS to identify its dependencies, identify license/copyright information, analyze software for vulnerabilities and malware, perform basic quality analysis. One or more of these outputs may contribute to final evaluation result/score and may result in blocking the introduction of the primary OSS.

#### Build Stage
* Semantics: Download, retrieve, assemble, and/or compile software into an executable and testable format. Download, retrieve, assemble, and/or compile documentation into a consumable format.
* Aliases: Compile

* Outputs: Generated Software, Generated Binaries
* Other Results and Side Effects: The Build stage may also capture and store point-in-time details about the pipeline environment and tools (compiler versions, package manager versions, task container versions in tekton, OS versions etc.). While the pipeline configuration should ideally be in source code, in reality some settings will likely depend on external factors. Storing this information in an immutable data store facilitates debugging, rebuilds, pipeline verification, audit records, and forensics. 

#### Test Stage
* Semantics: Test, scan, verify, and lint software and documentation.
* Aliases: Verify
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries
* Outputs: Test/Lint/Scan Records, Test/Lint/Scan Reports, Test/Lint/Scan Coverage Reports

#### Deploy Stage
* Semantics: Deploy software artificats and documentation to any environment other than the pipeline environment. Verify successful deployment.
* Aliases: Install
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries, Deployment KPIs
* Outputs: Deployment Records, Deployment Reports, Secrets to access deployed resources
* Other Results and Side Effects: Documentation hosted in a review, staging or production environment. Software running in a review, staging or production environment. Deployment KPIs might influence how the deployment proceeds; for example, for Canary or Blue/Green deployments.

#### Inputs and Outputs for Pipeline Stages

| Stage Name | Software Source | Binary Source | Generated Software | Generated Binaries | Secrets | Pipeline Environment | Pipeline Workspace | Return Codes | Results, Records and Reports | Logs |
| :--------: | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---- |

(The effort of proposing a common vocabulary across CI/CD Tools and Technologies is not yet performed, but we'll use the most common term from the table above as the working term.)

While CI/CD tools and technologies generally give developers broad leeway in naming and implementing their Pipeline Steps, agreeing upon some common terms will help develop more pluggable pipelines. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Each type of Pipeline Step will generally have several implementations that are tool specific. For example, Source will have implementations for various Source Code Management (SCM) tools. Publish will have implementations for each type of repository, and so on.

* Semantics: Create the software artifact(s) that will be published. To specify the version of the software this pipeline is producing, the package step(s) may use a software version that's specified in the source code, or calculate and automatically update the version using semver logic.
* Aliases: Containerize
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries, Dependency List/Graph
* Outputs: Packaged Artifacts (Software, Documentation or Binaries), Container Images, Image Tags, Image Digests, Archives
* Other Results and Side Effects: N/A

#### Tag
* Semantics: Annotate source code, artifacts/images, and so on with information, such as the version number and a description.
* Aliases: Annotate, Version
* Inputs: Source Code Reference (Repository, Branch, Commit), Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries
* Outputs: Tag/annotation metadata
* Other Results and Side Effects: Tags/annotations have been added to the software.

#### Sign
* Semantics: Use a cryptographic method to authenticate the software. The signature may also include information about the source of the software, how or where it was built, and what level of approval it has received (staging, production, etc.).
* Aliases: N/A
* Inputs: Packaged Artifacts
* Outputs: Signed Artifacts, Signing Record(s)
* Other Results and Side Effects: N/A

#### Policy
* Semantics: Verifies that policies are followed, for example:  software is from a trusted source, source repositories are configured correctly, Kubernetes manifests are configured securely, dependencies are signed, code standards are followed, code reviews are completed, there is a secure chain of custody, or appropriate work items or change requests are associated with the change.
* Aliases: Check, Provenance
* Inputs: Policies, Outputs of other steps
* Outputs: Policy and/or Provenance Reports
* Other Results and Side Effects: Side effects could include blocking a PR/commit so it can't be merged, discarding or approving an artifact/image.

#### Publish
* Semantics: Upload software artifacts and documentation to another repository. May also update catalogs, mirrors, release notes, etc.
* Aliases: Push, Upload, Release
* Inputs: Packaged (Signed) Artifacts
* Outputs: Repository URLs
* Other Results and Side Effects: Repositories are updated.

#### Provision
* Semantics: Request that a new physical or virtual server, network, or other resource be allocated or created.  Examples include a test cluster or object storage.
* Aliases: Obtain, Request, Allocate
* Inputs: Resource Request Parameters
* Outputs: Provisioned Resources (with connection info)
* Other Results and Side Effects: Resources are provisioned.

#### Deploy
* Semantics: Make changes to any environment other than the pipeline environment. Configure the environment. Deploy dependencies, software artificts and/or documentation.
* Aliases: Install, Configure
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries, Dependency List/Graph, Packaged Artifacts, Provisioned Resources
* Outputs: Routes to Deployments (with connection info). Deployment Records. Secrets to access deployed resources.
* Other Results and Side Effects: Software running in another environment. Documentation hosted in another environment. 

#### Verify Deployment
* Semantics: Verify successful deployment of software or documentation.
* Aliases: Smoke Test
* Inputs: Provisioned Resources, Routes to Deployments, Secrets to access deployed resources.
* Outputs: Deployment Verification Results, Deployment Verification Records
* Other Results and Side Effects: N/A

#### Analyze
* Semantics: Perform additional processing and analytics based on the results of a previous activity.
* Aliases: Metrics, Score, Grade, Parse
* Inputs: Any
* Outputs: Analysis Results, Analysis Reports
* Other Results and Side Effects: N/A

#### Message
* Semantics: Send a message to another system; for example, a Slack message or an Email. This is different from "Create Request" because the pipeline doesn't need to store a link/handle for the message.
* Aliases: N/A
* Inputs: Output of previous steps.
* Outputs: Message Return Code / Results
* Other Results and Side Effects: Message sent.

#### Create Request
* Semantics: Create a request in another system; for example, create a Change Request that must be approved for a deployment to production. This is different from "Message" because we need to get a link/reference for the new request, and store it, so we can potentially update it later.
* Aliases: Approval, Ticket, Issue, Work Item
* Inputs: Source Code Reference (Repository, Branch, Commit), Link to Previous Work Item, Provisioned Resources, Routes to Deployments
* Outputs: Request Return Code/Results, Link to New Request
* Other Results and Side Effects: Request created.

#### Update Record
* Semantics: Update a record in another system; for example, update and close a Change Request after a deployment to production; or, update a Github issue with the results of a policy check.
* Aliases: Editor
* Inputs: Source Code Reference (Repository, Branch, Commit), Link to Previous Request, Provisioned Resources, Routes to Deployments
* Outputs: Update Return Code/Results, Link to Request
* Other Results and Side Effects: Request record updated.

#### Run
* Semantics: Run a script or program that doesn't fall into one of the other categories. Often executes in another container.
* Aliases: Execute
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries, Packaged Artifacts, Provisioned Resources, Routes to Deployments
* Outputs: Output or results of the script or program.
* Other Results and Side Effects: Whatever the script or program has done.

#### Record Results
* Semantics: Record and report pipeline results and compliance evidence. Store pipeline artifacts for long-term archival.
* Aliases: Audit, Attestation, Evidence, Report
* Inputs: Any
* Outputs: Compliance Reports, Archive Files, Return Code/Results
* Other Results and Side Effects: Results, logs, reports, compliance evidence, and other pipeline artifacts are uploaded and/or archived.

#### Cleanup
* Semantics: Release pipeline resources, de-provision environments, delete pipeline workspace and pipeline container(s).
* Aliases: Finalize, Finish
* Inputs: Pipeline Environment, Pipeline Workspace, Provisioned Resources, Routes to Deployments
* Outputs: Return Code/Results
* Other Results and Side Effects: Deleted Pipeline Environment and Pipeline Workspace, De-provisioned Resources, Deleted Deployments

#### Inputs and Outputs for Pipeline Steps

The inputs and outputs listed in this table are the ones that are used by more than one step. These inputs and outputs need to be in a location and/or format that the pipeline steps expect so they can be processed correctly.

With the exception of the Setup and Cleanup steps, all steps have the following inputs: Secrets, Pipeline Environment, Pipeline Workspace, Parameters for the Step; and the following outputs: Return Codes, Results, Records and Reports, Logs.
